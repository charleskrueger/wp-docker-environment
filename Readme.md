# Disability Scoop Wordpress Environment

This is a full development environment for the Disability Scoop (DS) website. It is built on top of [Docker] with the hopes of starting up a dev environment on a local machine to quickly run wordpress, migrate the latest version of the live disabilityscoop.com wordpress database, and edit the DS wordpress theme.
